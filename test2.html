        <ul>
          <li>Different types of tests match up with different artifacts</li>
          <li>Different types of tests reveal/confirm different types of issues/features</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="what-types-of-tests">What types of tests?</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Unit Testing (P474)
            <ul>
              <li>Step-by-step with coding</li>
              <li>In OOD, a unit is usually a class</li>
              <li>In functional development, it can be a method/function being tested</li>
              <li>Makes use of stubs and drivers</li>
              <li>Should be automated</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Integration Testing
            <ul>
              <li>Test the quality of the documentation and communication</li>
              <li>Finding side effects</li>
              <li>ncremental integration is best</li>
              <li>Top-down or Bottom-up
                <ul>
                  <li>Top-down
                    <ul>
                      <li>Verifies major control or decision points early</li>
                      <li>Depth-first: tests integration of critical paths of modules</li>
                      <li>Breadth-first: is good as integration is often tight along a horizontal layer</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Bottom-up

                      <li>builds (or clusters) are groupings of low-level modules that have been integrated</li>
                      <li>drivers test these integrated clusters</li>
                      <li>as you move up, throw out the drivers and replace with next level to be integrated</li>

        <h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

        <h2 id="what-are-requirements">What are requirements?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>“Requirements are capabilities and conditions to which the system–and more broadly, the project–must conform”</li>
          <li>“Inception is Not the Requirements Phase”</li>
          <li>Needs drive features, features drive requirements</li>
          <li>Requirements are best when understood by both developers and customers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="what-are-stories">What are stories?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>In Scrum, a Story is a brief statement of intent describing something the system can do for a user</li>
          <li>Stories are negotiable, and should be small enough to make good estimates on</li>
          <li>User Stories are what we are mostly concerned with</li>
          <li>Stories can also include other work items, but those aren’t really related to requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="what-are-features">What are features?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Bridge gap between User needs and Software Solutions (Requirements)</li>
          <li>Most systems described in 25-50 features  Features are Program Backlog items in Scrum</li>
          <li>You can Acceptance Test features</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="when-we-must-have-requirements">When we must have requirements?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Design and development start while only 10-20% of requirements are established</li>
          <li>Requirements, even established ones change</li>
          <li>“on average, 25% of requirements change on software projects”</li>
          <li>Study on waterfall-esque requirements showed 45% were never used, 19 % were rarely used</li>
          <li>Iterative approach: have the requirements you need, when you require them.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Most problems you face have already been solved</li>
          <li>The trick is to find the solution and apply it within your design-space</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h4>

        <p>Pattern-based design creates a new application by finding a set of proven solutions to a clearly delineated set of
          problems. Each problem and its solution is described by a design pattern that has been cataloged and vetted by
          other software engineers who have encountered the problem and implemented the solution while designing other applications.
          Each design pattern provides you with a proven approach to one part of the problem to be solved.</p>

        <h4 id="who-does-it">Who does it?</h4>

        <p>A software engineer examines each problem encountered for a new application and then attempts to fi nd a relevant
          solution by searching one or more patterns repositories.</p>

        <h4 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it important?</h4>
        <p>Have you ever heard the phrase “reinventing the wheel”? It happens all the time in software development, and it’s
          a waste of time and energy. By using existing design patterns, you can acquire a proven solution for a specifi
          c problem. As each pattern is applied, solutions are integrated and the application to be built moves closer to
          a complete design.</p>

        <h4 id="what-are-the-steps">What are the steps?</h4>
        <p>The requirements model is examined in order to isolate the hierarchical set of problems to be solved. The problem
          space is partitioned so that subsets of problems associated with specifi c software functions and features can
          be identifi ed. Problems can also be organized by type: architectural, component-level, algorithmic, user interface,
          and so forth. Once a subset of problems is defi ned, one or more pattern repositories are searched to determine
          if an existing design pattern, represented at an appropriate level of abstraction, exists. Patterns that are applicable
          are adapted to the specifi c needs of the software to be built. Custom problem solving is applied in situations
          for which no patterns can be found.</p>

        <h4 id="what-is-the-work-product">What is the work product?</h4>
        <p>A design model that depicts the architectural structure, user interface, and component-level detail is developed.</p>

        <h4 id="how-do-i-ensure-that-ive-done-it-right">How do I ensure that I’ve done it right?</h4>
        <p>As each design pattern is translated into some element of the design model, work products are reviewed for clarity,
          correctness, completeness, and consistency with requirements and with one another.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It turns out that while this is effectively true, there’s more effort than is implied</li>
          <li>Still, developers have built up many pattern repositories to help with all sorts of software design</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="a-general-approach-to-general-patterns">A General Approach to General Patterns</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Problems have context, and qualities, which pressman calls “forces”</li>
          <li>Given a context and the qualities of a problem, the goal is to find the best matching solution.</li>
          <li>An effective design pattern in the following way:
            <ul>
              <li>It solves a problem</li>
              <li>It is a proven concept</li>
              <li>The solution isn’t obvious</li>
              <li>It describes a relationship</li>
              <li>The pattern has a significant human component (minimize human intervention)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>“Design patterns, if used effectively, will invariably make you a better software designer.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="pattern-types-and-standard-groups">Pattern Types and Standard Groups</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>There are many kinds of patterns
            <ul>
              <li>Architectural</li>
              <li>Data</li>
              <li>Component (or Design)</li>
              <li>User Interface</li>
              <li>WebApp</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>GoF broke patterns into groups
            <ul>
              <li>Creational: focus on creation, composition and representation of objects while hiding how these things are
                done</li>
              <li>Structural: focus on how objects are organized and integrated to create something larger</li>
              <li>Behavioural: focus on the assignment of responsibility between objects and the manner in which they communicate</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="approaches-to-pattern-based-software-design">Approaches to Pattern-Based Software Design</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Frameworks can facilitate the application of some types of patterns (SOENEA)
            <ul>
              <li>Note that frameworks are not patterns, as they are “embodied in code”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Describing the problem carefully is key in identifying an appropriate pattern</li>
          <li>Pattern languages and pattern repositories can make communicating and finding patterns easier</li>
          <li>Look for ways to apply existing design patterns (vs. trying to create something new)</li>
          <li>Quality considerations are built into good patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="thinking-in-patterns">Thinking in Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mental Design Steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Keep the big picture in mind</li>
              <li>See the patterns in the big picture</li>
              <li>Form these patterns into a context for your later design work</li>
              <li>Work inwards from this context, looking for pattern at gradually lower levels</li>
              <li>Repeat until design is fleshed out</li>
              <li>Refine your design by adapting patterns to your specific software</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>A pattern choice at one level, may well affect pattern choices below or laterally</li>
          <li>Patterns are connected, they are not independant</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="design-tasks">Design Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pressman suggests following design tasks related to the Mental Design Steps.</li>
          <li>Determine the domain, and find a related pattern language or pattern repository</li>
          <li>Search for architectural patterns to apply for that domain in the specific problem</li>
          <li>In areas where architectural patterns have been defined, focus on subsystem or component-level (GoF design) patterns.
          </li>
          <li>Keep cycling through till the broad system is covered for both architectural and design/subsystem level patterns</li>
          <li>If GUI patterns are identified, review GUI design patterns against known pattern repositories</li>
          <li>Refine all these patterns carefully to match up with your actual problem context</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>People don’t spend enough time fully understanding the problem</li>
          <li>People choose a wrong pattern, and then stick to it, unable or unwilling to see that it is wrong</li>
          <li>People apply patterns too literally, not willing to refine appropriately for the specific problem, or just being
            pedantic about their application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="architectural-patterns">Architectural Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>These decisions impose constraints on all lower level design</li>
          <li>These patterns are the hardest to change once decided on</li>
          <li>These patterns address the structure of the application and key risk areas</li>
          <li>On the bright side, the application of these patterns is often well understood for specific domains (e.g. e-commerce
            site)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="architectural-pattern-domains">Architectural Pattern Domains</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Access Control</strong>: patterns that address restricting access to information or behaviour</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concurrency</strong>: patterns doing many things at once, most commonly because many users may use the system
            at once (e.g. Enterprise Applications). This can include task schedulers or other mechanisms to avoid problems
            that arise from concurrency.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Distribution</strong>: These patterns apply when an application is not isolated to one system (or process). These
            patterns address the various problems and standard solutions (e.g. web applications)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Persistence</strong>: Persistence of data can vary from text files to databases, and architectural patterns cover
            the retrieval and storage or persisted data, as well as the means to properly integrate it into a running application
            and back again.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="component-level-patterns">Component-Level Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Often focus on a functional element of a system</li>
          <li>Pressman presents it very similarly to the UI patterns</li>
          <li>Generally appears to focus on mid-level interactions with the system (this section felt unhelpful, even with the
            example)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="ui-design-patterns">UI Design Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>These describe established solutions to known UI problems</li>
          <li>Generally deal with layout styles or navigation</li>
          <li>Often they are effectively widgets with known behaviours to adress a problem (calendar date-picker, etc.)</li>
          <li>While there is no general guidance in Pressman as to what these really are, the listed patterns are good guidance,
            and finding pattern repos related to these elements is worthwhile (JQuery UI comes to mind).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="more-grasp-patterns">More GRASP Patterns</h2>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These patterns are closer to the traditional GoF design patterns than the first five we looked at.</li>
          <li>Keep in mind what you see here for when we consider the GoF patterns</li>
          <li>This will give you a robust pattern language to discuss software design with</li>
          <li>I notice here that Larman is keen on describing GRASP patterns in sequence diagrams. Interesting, I’d taken an
            alternate approach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: Handling alternatives based on type, creating pluggable software components</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: When related behaviour varies by type, assign responsibility for the behaviour to the types
            for which the behaviour varies, generally by using polymorphic operations.</li>
          <li>Implementing the same interface does this, but it can be done just as well with dynamic binding.</li>
          <li>Overloading methods or the use of the Visitor pattern can extend how this approach can be applied.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="pure-fabrication">Pure Fabrication</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: When you do not want to violate High Cohesion or Low Coupling (or other things), but you do
            not have a suitable option.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: Assign highly cohesive behaviors to an artificial/convenience class.</li>
          <li>Many of you implemented the Deck parser inside existing classes following Information Expert, but that led to lots
            of unrelated behaviour and strange coupling.</li>
          <li>Inventing a DeckParser class creates something that does not exist in your Domain Model, but which could cleanly
            address the problem.</li>
          <li>Eliminate a bad design based on other GRASP patterns with a good design that is generally more reusable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="pure-fabrications-practices">Pure Fabrications Practices</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Not always important to identify Pure Fabrication</li>
          <li>It is important to know when to use it to improve design</li>
          <li>e.g. when explaining why an Information Expert approach was not used, answer that it would have led to high coupling
            or low cohesion (but not because Pure Fabrication, that’s the solution, not the reason)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="bad-pure-fabrication">Bad Pure Fabrication</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes people apply
            <strong>behavioural decomposition</strong> such that a Pure Fabrication class wraps a single function, or very few functions.
            This is bad.</li>
          <li>Decomposition in that direction may seem natural, but it should be avoided so that
            <strong>representational decomposition</strong> can be more valuable… leaving some behaviours in non Pure Fabrication
            classes as appropriate.</li>
          <li>This type of overuse is often indicated by Low Cohesion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="indirection">Indirection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: Need to avoid direct coupling between two or more things, keeping coupling low and reuse potential
            high</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: Assign responsibility to an intermediate object that mediates between other components or
            services, thus removing direct coupling</li>
          <li>These often lead to
            <strong>Adapters</strong>, and generally serve to hide the mess of managing such flexibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="protected-variation">Protected Variation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: variance and instability in one element can perpetuate instability to related elements</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: Identify points of predicted variation or instability and assign responsibilities to create
            a stable interface around them (broad use of the term interface).</li>
          <li>Whereas Indirection was to address coupling for the sake of coupling, this approach targets a more specific problem
            (though the two can be very related).</li>
          <li>This is all about data encapsulation and information hiding, core OO design tricks</li>
          <li>With experience, you can see exactly where to apply this most of the time</li>
          <li>Still very valuable to understand</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: Exactly one instance of a class is allowed. Other objects need a golbal and single point of
            access</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: Define a static method of the class that returns the singleton</li>
          <li>Concurrency control is common around Singletons.</li>
          <li>Example: TODO</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="why-not-make-it-all-static">Why not make it all static?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>instance-methods allow subclassing, refinement (overloading) of the Singleton class for effective reuse. Static
            methods aren’t polymorphic, and generally don’t support overwriting in languages where such things are allowed
            (part of the definition of the class)</li>
          <li>Remote access methods generally support only instance-methods. (e.g. Java’s RMI)</li>
          <li>A class is not always needed as a singleton in all applications. Sometimes you figure out it’s not a singleton
            later. Instance-based, this is an easy fix (generally you don’t need to do anything).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="singleton-in-action">Singleton in Action</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In my Masters thesis I advised the use of a variant on this pattern to allow the trivial creation of a single-access
            point within a web request, the ThreadLocal Singleton. Each request was guaranteed a Thread for its sole use
            for the duration of the request. Request Attributes, standard fare for web applications, were readily stored
            in this ThreadLocal Singleton so did not have to be passed around through various Commands and Views, thus greatly

        <h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: Algorithms or policies can or will change, need to be decided at run-time</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: Define each algorithm/policy/strategy in a separate class with a common interface</li>
          <li>Often this leads to the instance of the strategy being created by a Factory that is passed enough info to know
            what to do.</li>
          <li>Polymorphism and Protected Variation at work!</li>
          <li>Example: TODO</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="composite">Composite</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: A number of similar objects need to be treated atomically</li>
          <li>Solution: Define an interface for composite objects that is shared with the atomic objects it composes</li>
          <li>works well with the strategy pattern, as certain strategies may just be several simpler strategies applied together
            (e.g. discounts)</li>
          <li>Composite of related elements starts looking like proper object-oriented design? Larmen gives a strange example
            called IDs to Objects</li>
          <li>when using composites, it’s generally a good practice to pass around the composites instead of digging out the
            children (components). Composite Pattern done well supports this.</li>
          <li>Example: TODO</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="facade">Facade</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: There are many components in a subsystem, each with some behaviour that is needed, but knowledge
            of this subsystem or access to the other behaviour is not</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: Define a single point of access that provides an interface on the desired behaviours and encapsulates
            knowledge of the weird subsystem so nothing else has to know about it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="observersubscriber">Observer/Subscriber</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem</strong>: Different things want to know about different events and will behave in different ways, but
            low coupling is desired</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Solution</strong>: define subscribers via an interface that listen, and then have them register to listen to
            publishers of events that they care about. The publishers will notify the correct subscribers at the correct
            times.</li>

        <h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

        <h2 id="architecture-1">Architecture</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>“In its simplest form, architecture is the structure or organization of program components(modules), the manner
            in which these components interact, and the structure of data that are used by the components” [1, p.223]</li>
          <li>“The logical architecture is the large-scale organization of the software classes into packages (or name spaces),
            subsystems, and layers”[2, p.199]</li>
          <li>“Architecture is what you have left when you take away everything you don’t need to explain how the system works”
            [3, p.393, by way of Krutchen]</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="architecture-as-structure-2-197-201">Architecture as Structure [2, 197-201]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Larman really only talks about the Layered style.</li>
          <li>A key focus in Larman is the organization of code, via package diagrams, into layers to communicate project structure.</li>
          <li>This logical organization to communicate structure still applies exactly the same way with other styles besides
            the Layered style.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="architecture-as-risk">Architecture as Risk</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Complex or high risk issues should be highlighted in the architecture</li>
          <li>These often end up being structural issues, or at least can end up being thought of that way once they are understood.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="n1-view-model-2-p655">N+1 View Model [2, p.655]</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>To learn about a system architecture, we need to look at it in different ways</li>
          <li>Larman describes what has evolved into the N+1 model for doing so, with each of N being one of the ways to look
            at the system</li>
          <li>The +1 represents key architectural use cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="architectural-recap">Architectural Recap</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>We are concerned with the overall important structure of the system</li>
          <li>We are concerned with risk areas of the system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="views-2-657-659">Views [2, 657-659]</h3>

        <p>Not all need be included, use the ones that communicate about architecturally relevant things</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Logical</li>
          <li>Process</li>
          <li>Deployment</li>
          <li>Data</li>

          <li>Development</li>
          <li>Use Cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="logical-2-p657">Logical [2, p.657]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Conceptual organization of the software in terms of important layers, subsystems, packages,frameworks, classes,
            and interface</li>
          <li>Summarizes functionality of major software elements</li>
          <li>Communicate use case realizations as interaction diagrams (usually sequence diagrams) to illustrate key aspects
            of the system</li>
          <li>Shows an important subset of the system design, generally by way of class diagrams and interaction diagrams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="process-2-p658">Process [2, p.658]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Processes and threads, their responsibilities, collaborations and allocations to elements described in the logical
            view.</li>
          <li>In a webapp, what do we know about Threads/Processes?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="deployment-2-p658">Deployment [2, p.658]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>A description of the physical deployment of processes and components to the various processing nodes of your system</li>
          <li>A description of the network configuration between nodes</li>
          <li>As some of you have explored, you can do a lot on the client-side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="data-2-p658">Data [2, p.658]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Overview of data flows, persistent data schemea, any object relational mappings between persistent data and in-memory
            objects.</li>
          <li>Communicate important stored-procedures or triggers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="security-2-p658">Security [2, p.658]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Overview of security schemes, points within the system (and architecture) where security is applied.</li>
          <li>I differ with Larman’s approach to a diagram focus for this. It may be doable some places, but text describing
            its application, supported by class/sequence (or any interaction diagrams) are best to describe this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="implementation-2-p658-659">Implementation [2, p.658-659]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>A view on not just the software code as given in the logical view or design, but including libraries and resources,
            all organized by their physical location in the system (folder structure)</li>
          <li>I imagine a discussion of framework or even moreso engine, is relevant here; Explaining the use of Unity and how
            it leads to an organization of files makes sense.</li>
          <li>Explanation of why should supplement any diagrams of file layout, etc.</li>
          <li>For example, a new member of a software team could use this view to guide their understanding of where files go
            and why they are organized in a given way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="development-2-p659">Development [2, p.659]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Description of the running and testing of the system.</li>
          <li>Also covers things like revision control usage and policies</li>
          <li>repo usage, convention and continious integration setup is appropriate here.</li>
          <li>Should probably also cover coding conventions, though not listed in Larman.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="use-cases-2-p659">Use Cases [2, p.659]</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Summary of most architecturally significant use cases</li>
          <li>Probably duplicate the UCM, but only showing those important UCs.</li>
          <li>Explanation of why and how are important, the diagram is just for convenience.</li>
        </ul>

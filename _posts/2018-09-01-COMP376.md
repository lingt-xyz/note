## 1. Game Development Fundamentals

### Properties of a Game

* Players
* Goals (say winning/losing)
* Choices that affect the outcome
* Rules
* Consequences of winning or losing that are optional

### Essential Elements of a Game

1. Paly Activity (Nonessential, recreational activity)
    * Play activity requires participation
    * Making different choices while playing the game a second time affects the results
2. Pretending (Mental ability to establish a notional reality)
    * Creates an artificial reality known as the magic circle
    * To leave the magic circle, stop playing the game
3. Goal (Desired result or condition the player seeks to achieve)
    * Every game must have a nontrivial goal or object
    * The rules define the goal
    * The player must overcome one or more challenges to achieve the goal
4. Rules
    * Rules are definitions and instructions that players accept for the game
    * Rules define the actions the players may select that will help them achieve the object of the game
    * Game designers must make the rules understandable to the player 

### Fundamental Characteristics of Games

1. Representation: A game is a closed formal system that represents a subset of reality + some fantasy.
    * A game is complete and self-sufficient.
    * Rules which are either explicit or implicit.
    * Collection of parts that interact with each other, often in complex ways.
    * Attempts to recreate or simulate some elements of reality, and allows fantasy to fill in the rest. 
2. Interaction
    * Some media for representing reality are static. 
        * E.g. photos, paintings, sculptures, etc.
    * Some are dynamic and change over time. 
        * E.g. movies, music, etc.
    * Games go even further and represent reality in an interactive fashion.
        * Players are allowed to directly affect other players and “reality” itself through their actions.
3. Conflict
    * Conflict arises naturally from the interaction of a game; conflict need not be violent.
    * The player actively pursues some goal while obstacles prevent goals from being easily achieved. Sources of conflict include:
        * Other players (including any computer agents)
        * Elements of the game environment
        * Time (in the case of races, etc.)
        * The player’s own self (in the case of puzzles, etc.)
4. Safety
    * Conflict implies danger; danger means risk of harm; harm is undesirable.
    * A game is a safe way to experience reality.
    * The results of a game should always be less harsh than the real world situations which the game models.
    * Safety, ironically, is the one element of games that players are willing to sacrifice to enhance the overall experience.

### Things That a Game Need Not Have
* Competition
* Conflict
* Entertainment
* Fun

### Characterizing Games
* Levels of Abstraction
    * Fiction
        * Fiction is the story the player is told; rationale for the game world.
        * Fiction draws the player into the game world and immerses the player.
        * Immersed players lose track of the real world outside the game.
        * Immersion can be
            * Tactical—the sense of being “in the groove”
            * Strategic—observing, calculating, planning
            * Narrative—the feeling of being inside a story
    * Player’s mental model
        * Mental model is the set of rules and data that the player infers and uses to make decisions.
        * Most often
            * The player must overcome a nontrivial challenge
            * Challenges require mental or physical effort
            * A challenge can be composed of several smaller challenges
            * Challenges can be required to reach the goal or optional to add game content

    * Abstract
        * Defined by the real rules, not merely players perception or fiction surrounding them.
        * Unlike other games (e.g., board games), video games often do not require written rules. 
            * The game enforces the rules. The player can’t change the rules
            * Games must provide adequate clues for players to overcome a challenge
            * Using trial and error to overcome a challenge frustrates many players
            * Discovering rules as the play progresses is part of the challenge in playing most video games.

### Progression and Emergence

* People love to create, design, and customize.

* This activity can have a direct effect on gameplay.

* Games allow experience to emerge from interactions with the game environment.

* There are two main ways the gameplay can evolve in a game:

    * Progression: the gameplay experience follows a script or plot. Also includes non-linear story telling.
    * Emergence: the complexity of the gameplay comes from the combination of simple elements. It makes games powerful, but is hard to design.

* If the game controls progression through the game world via a well defined plot, it is (typically) less emergent gameplay. In essence, in a progressive game, the player is playing against the designer.

* Emergence is difficult to design (and playtest). In an emergent game, the player is playing against the environment.

* Most games have more progression than emergence.

* As video games reach a wider audience, creative and expressive play become increasingly important.

## 1 Fundamental Principles of Counting

### 1.1 The Rules of Sum and Product

* The Rule of Sum: If a first task can be performed in {% raw %}$$m$${% endraw %} ways, while a second task can be performed in {% raw %}$$ n$${% endraw %} ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in any one of {% raw %}$$ m + n$${% endraw %} ways.
* The Rule of Product: If a procedure can be broken down into first and second stages, and if there are {% raw %}$$ m$${% endraw %} possible outcomes for the first stage and if, for each of these outcomes, there are {% raw %}$$ n$${% endraw %} possible outcomes for the second stage, then the total procedure can be carried out, in the designated order, in {% raw %}$$ mn$${% endraw %} ways.

### 1.2 Permutations

* Definition 1.1 For an integer {% raw %}$$n\geqslant0$${% endraw %}, {% raw %}$$n factorial$${% endraw %} (denoted {% raw %}$$n!$${% endraw %}) is defined by
{% raw %}
$$
n! =
\begin{cases}
1,  & \text{if $n=0$} \\
(n)(n-1)(n-2)\dots(3)(2)(1), & \text{if $n\geqslant1$}
\end{cases}
$$
{% endraw %}
* Definition 1.2 Given a collection of {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} distinct objects, any (linear) arrangement of these objects is called a {% raw %}$$permutation$${% endraw %} of the collection. The number of permutations of size {% raw %}$$r$${% endraw %}, where {% raw %}$$0\leqslant r\leqslant n$${% endraw %}, from a collection of {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} objects, is 
{% raw %}
$$
P(n,r)={(n)(n-1)(n-2)\dots(n-r+1)(n-r)(n-r-1)\dots(3)(2)(1)\over(n-r)(n-r-1)\dots(3)(2)(1)}={n!\over(n-r)!}
$$
{% endraw %}

> Anagram: a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. Anagram is also called permulations.

e.g.: 

* ART: {% raw %}$$3\times2\times1=6$${% endraw %}
* MATH: {% raw %}$$4\times3\times2\times1=24$${% endraw %}
* CHAPTER: four letters word is {% raw %}$$7\times6\times5\times4$${% endraw %}
* Put *A*, *B*, *C* into 10 numbered boxes
    1. At most one per box: {% raw %}$$10\times9\times8=P(10,3)$${% endraw %}
    2. If boxes can get more than one: {% raw %}$$10\times10\times10$${% endraw %}
* *3* Objects into *10* numbered boxe, at most one per box:
    1. If Objects are identical (they are the same): {% raw %}$${P(10, 3)\over3!}$${% endraw %}
    2. Otherwise: {% raw %}$$C(10, 3)={10!\over7!\times3!}=\binom{10}{3}$${% endraw %}
* How many 4 digital decimal numbers:
    1. If allow *0*: {% raw %}$$10\times10\times10\times10$${% endraw %}
    2. If allow *0* but no repeated digits: {% raw %}$$10\times9\times8\times7$${% endraw %}
    3. If no leading *0* and no repeated digits: {% raw %}$$9\times9\times8\times7$${% endraw %}
* How many 5 digital numbers:
    1. Must contain *0*: 

        {% raw %}$$
        \left.
        \begin{array}{l}
        0\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_:&10^4\\
        \_\quad 0\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_:&10^4\\
        \_\quad \_\quad 0\quad \_\quad \_:&10^4\\
        \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad 0\quad \_:&10^4\\
        \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad 0:&10^4
        \end{array}
        \right\}
        =5\times10^4
        $${% endraw %}

        * How about {% raw %}$$\color{red}{00012}$${% endraw %}, it was counted three times.
        * {% raw %}$$10^5 - 9^5$${% endraw %}: {% raw %}$$9^5$${% endraw %} is who does not contain {% raw %}$$0$${% endraw %}.
    2. Must contain *0* and *1*: {% raw %}$$10^5-9^5-9^5\color{red}{+8^5}$${% endraw %}
* Choose a committe of *3* from *80* students:
    1. (It's a committe, so order does not matter): {% raw %}$$\binom{80}{3}=C(80, 3)={80!\over77!\times3!}$${% endraw %}
    2. If choose *77*, should be the same: {% raw %}$$\binom{80}{77}=C(80, 77)={80!\over3!\times77!}$${% endraw %}
* Choose a committe of *6*; *3* of them are from *60* cs students and *3* of them are from *20* math students:
     {% raw %}$$\binom{60}{3}\times\binom{20}{3}$${% endraw %}
* *6* TAs, assign each TA to one time slot (A: 1-2pm; B: 2-3pm; C: 3-4pm), and every time slot should have *2* TAs:
    1. M1: {% raw %}$$\binom{6}{2}\times\binom{4}{2}\times\binom{2}{2}$${% endraw %}
    2. M2: think it differently. Because every TA should be assigned to one time slot, so the first time slot has *6* choices, and the second time slot has *5* choices, and so on. It becomes to an anagram problem.

        {% raw %}$$
        \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad \_\quad 
        $${% endraw %}

        But in each time slot, the TAs' order does not matter:

        {% raw %}$$
        {6!\over2!\times2!\times2!}
        $${% endraw %}
* BANANAS
    1. {% raw %}$${7!\over3!\times2!} $${% endraw %}
    2. What if no adjecent *A*s:

        {% raw %}$$
        \_B\_N\_N\_S\_
        \begin{cases}
        \text{BNNS}:  & 4!/2! \\
        A \text{ can be put to 5 positions:} & \binom{5}{3}
        \end{cases}
        \\
        \text{In total: }{4!\over2!}\times\binom{5}{3}
        $${% endraw %}
* Example 1.16 If six people, designated as A,B,...,F, are seated about a round table, how many different circular arrangements are possible, if arrangements are considered the same when eone can be obtained from the other by rotation?
    6!/6=5!=120
* Example 1.17
    3X2X2X2X1X1=12
* Put 15 different books into two shelves so that there is at least one book on each shelf? (Consider the books in each arrangement to e stacked one next to each other, with the first book on each shelf at the left of the shelf.)
    * Seperate them (1,2,3,...,15) into two parts, so a bar can be put at 14 positions: 15!*14
    * Three shelves: 15!*C(14,2)
    * For two shelves: why 15!*(2^15-2) is not right?

### 1.3 Combinations: The Binomial Theorem

* Theorem 1.1 {% raw %}$$The Binomial Theorem$${% endraw %}. If {% raw %}$$x$${% endraw %} and {% raw %}$$y$${% endraw %} are variables and {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} is a positive integer, then
    {% raw %}
    $$
    (x+y)^n=\binom{n}{0}x^0y^n+\binom{n}{1}x^1y^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}x^2y^{n-2}+\dots+\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}y^1+\binom{n}{n}x^{n}y^0=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}x^ky^{n-k}
    $$
    {% endraw %}

    Proof: Take {% raw %}$$n=4$${% endraw %} for example. The coefficient of {% raw %}$$x^2y^2$${% endraw %} in the expansion of the product

    {% raw %}
    $$
    (x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)
    $$
    {% endraw %}
    is the number of ways in which we can select two *x*'s from four *x*'s, one of which is available in each factor.
    
    That is, the coefficient of {% raw %}$$x^2y^2$${% endraw %} in the expansion of {% raw %}$$(x+y)^4 \text{ is } \binom{4}{2}=6$${% endraw %}, the number of ways to select two distinct objects from a collection of four distinct objects.
        
    

* Corollary 1.1 For each integer {% raw %}$$n\gt0$${% endraw %}.

    {% raw %}
    $$ 
    \binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}+\binom{n}{2}+\dots+\binom{n}{n}=2^n\\
    \binom{n}{0}-\binom{n}{1}+\binom{n}{2}-\dots+(-1)^n\binom{n}{n}=0
    $$
    {% endraw %}

## 4 Properties of the Integers: Mathematical Induction

### 4.1 The Well-Ordering Principle: Mathematical Induction

* The Well-Ordering Principle: Every *nonempty* subset of {% raw %}$${\Bbb Z}^+$${% endraw %} contains a smallest element. (We often express this by saying that {% raw %}$${\Bbb Z}^+$${% endraw %} is *well ordered*.)

* Theorem 4.1 *The Principle of Mathematical Induction*. Let {% raw %}$$S(n)$${% endraw %} denote an open mathematical statement ( or set of such open statements) that involves one or more occurrences of the variable {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %}, which represents a positive interger.
    1. If {% raw %}$$S(1)$${% endraw %} is true; and
    2. If whenever {% raw %}$$S(k)$${% endraw %} is true (for some particular, but arbitrarily chosen, {% raw %}$$k\in {\Bbb Z}^+$${% endraw %}), then {% raw %}$$S(k+1)$${% endraw %} is true;
    3. Then {% raw %}$$S(n)$${% endraw %} is true for all {% raw %}$${n\in \Bbb Z}^+$${% endraw %}.

### 4.2 Recursive Definitions


* e.g. {% raw %}$$\sum_{i=0}^k F_i^2=F_k\times F_{k+1}\text{, for all }k\geq1$${% endraw %} by Induction

    1. Base: 
        * {% raw %}$$k=1$${% endraw %}: {% raw %}$$\sum_{i=0}^1 F_i^2=F_0+F_1=1=F_1\times F_2$${% endraw %}
        * {% raw %}$$k=2$${% endraw %}: {% raw %}$$\sum_{i=0}^2 F_i^2=F_0+F_1+F_2=2=F_2\times F_3$${% endraw %} (why need k=2?)
    2. Inductive Hypothesis:

        Assume {% raw %}$$\sum_{i=0}^k F_i^2=F_k\times F_{k+1}\text{, for all }k=1,2,\dots,n\text{; that is, }k\leq n$${% endraw %}
    3. Inductive Step:

        Must prove {% raw %}$$\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} F_i^2=F_{n+1}\times F_{(n+1)+1}$${% endraw %}

    4. Proof:

        {% raw %}$$
        \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} F_i^2 & = \sum_{i=0}^{n} F_i^2 + F_{n+1}^2 \\
        & = F_n\times F_{n+1} + F_{n+1}^2 \\ 
        & = F_{n+1}\times (F_n+F_{n+1}) \\ 
        & = F_{n+1}\times F_{n+2} \\ 
        & = F_{n+1}\times F_{(n+1)+1}
        \end{align*}

        $${% endraw %}

## 8 The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion

### 8.1 The Priciple of Inclusion and Exclusion

* <green>Theorem 8.1</green> The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion. Consider a set {% raw %}$$S\text{, with }\mathbf{card}(S)=N$${%endraw%}, and conditions {%raw%}$$c_i, 1\leqslant i\leqslant t$${%endraw%}, each of which may be satisfied by some of the elements of {% raw %}$$S$${%endraw%}. The number of elements of {% raw %}$$S$${%endraw%} that satisfy *none* of the conditions {%raw%}$$c_i, 1\leqslant i\leqslant t$${%endraw%}, is denoted by {%raw%}$$\overline {N}=N(\bar { c_1} \bar { c_2} \bar { c_3} \dots \bar { c_t})$${%endraw%} where

{% raw %}$$

\begin{align}
\overline { N} = & N\\
& -[N(c_1)+N(c_2)+N(c_3)+\dots + N(c_t)] \\
& +  [N(c_1 c_2)+N(c_1 c_3)+\dots+N(c_1 c_t)+N(c_2 c_3+\dots+N(c_{t-1} c_t))]\\ 
& -  [N(c_1 c_2 c_3)+N(c_1 c_2 c_4)+\dots+N(c_1 c_2 c_t)+N(c_1 c_3 c_4)+\dots+N(c_1 c_3 c_t)+\dots +N(c_{t-2} c_{t-1} c_t)]\\ 
& + \\
& \dots \\
& + (-1)^t N(c_1 c_2 c_3 \dots c_t)
\end{align}

$${% endraw %}

or 

{% raw %}$$

\begin{align}
\overline {N} = N - \sum_{1\leqslant i \leqslant t} N(c_i) + \sum_{1\leqslant i \lt j \leqslant t} N(c_i c_j) - \sum_{1\leqslant i \lt j \lt k \leqslant t} N(c_i c_j c_k) +  \dots + (-1)^t N(c_1 c_2 c_3 \dots c_t)
\end{align}

$${% endraw %}

* e.g.:
    A set of *S* contains 68 students in COMP 339. 

    Condition 1: Students from Computer Science; 

    Condition 2: Students from Math.

    {% raw %}$$

    N(\bar{c_1})

$${% endraw %}



* <green>Corollary 8.1</green> Under the hypotheses of Theorem 8.1, the number of elements in {% raw %}$$S$${%endraw%} that satisfy at least one of the condition {% raw %}$$c_i\text{, where }1\leqslant i\leqslant t$${%endraw%}, is given by {% raw %}$$N(c_1\text{ or }c_2\text{ or }\dots\text{ or } c_t)=N-\overline{N}$${%endraw%}

### 8.2 Generalization of the Principle

* Theorem 8.2 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 8.1, for each {% raw %}$$1\leqslant m\leqslant t$${% endraw %}, the number of elements in {% raw %}$$S$${% endraw %} that satisfy *exactly* {% raw %}$$m$${% endraw %} of the conditions {% raw %}$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_t$${% endraw %} is given by

    {% raw %}$$
    E_m=S_m-\binom{m+1}{1}S_{m+1}+\binom{m+2}{2}S_{m+2}-\dots +(-1)^{t-m}\binom{t}{t-m}S_t
    $${% endraw %}

    If {% raw %}$$m=0$${% endraw %}, we obtain Theorem 8.1

* Corollary 8.2 {% raw %}$$L_m=S_m-\binom{m}{m-1}S_{m+1}+\binom{m+1}{m-1}S_{m+2}-\dots +(-1)^{t-m}\binom{t-1}{m-1}S_t$${% endraw %}

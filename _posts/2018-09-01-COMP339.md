## 1 Fundamental Principles of Counting

### 1.1 The Rules of Sum and Product

* The Rule of Sum: If a first task can be performed in {% raw %}$$m$${% endraw %} ways, while a second task can be performed in {% raw %}$$ n$${% endraw %} ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in any one of {% raw %}$$ m + n$${% endraw %} ways.

* The Rule of Product: If a procedure can be broken down into first and second stages, and if there are {% raw %}$$ m$${% endraw %} possible outcomes for the first stage and if, for each of these outcomes, there are {% raw %}$$ n$${% endraw %} possible outcomes for the second stage, then the total procedure can be carried out, in the designated order, in {% raw %}$$ mn$${% endraw %} ways.

### 1.2 Permutations

* Definition 1.1 For an integer {% raw %}$$n\geqslant0$${% endraw %}, {% raw %}$$n factorial$${% endraw %} (denoted {% raw %}$$n!$${% endraw %}) is defined by
{% raw %}
$$
n! =
\begin{cases}
1,  & \text{if $n=0$} \\
(n)(n-1)(n-2)\dots(3)(2)(1), & \text{if $n\geqslant1$}
\end{cases}
$$
{% endraw %}

* Definition 1.2 Given a collection of {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} distinct objects, any (linear) arrangement of these objects is called a {% raw %}$$permutation$${% endraw %} of the collection. The number of permutations of size {% raw %}$$r$${% endraw %}, where {% raw %}$$0\leqslant r\leqslant n$${% endraw %}, from a collection of {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} objects, is 
{% raw %}
$$
P(n,r)={(n)(n-1)(n-2)\dots(n-r+1)(n-r)(n-r-1)\dots(3)(2)(1)\over(n-r)(n-r-1)\dots(3)(2)(1)}={n!\over(n-r)!}
$$
{% endraw %}

    > Anagram: a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. Anagram is also called permulations.

    e.g.: 
    
    1. ART: {% raw %}$$3\times2\times1=6$${% endraw %}
    2. MATH: {% raw %}$$4\times3\times2\times1=24$${% endraw %}
    2. CHAPTER: four letters word is {% raw %}$$7\times6\times5\times4$${% endraw %}

### 1.3 Combinations: The Binomial Theorem

* Theorem 1.1 {% raw %}$$The Binomial Theorem$${% endraw %}. If {% raw %}$$x$${% endraw %} and {% raw %}$$y$${% endraw %} are variables and {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} is a positive integer, then
{% raw %}
$$
(x+y)^n=\binom{n}{0}x^0y^n+\binom{n}{1}x^1y^{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}x^2y^{n-2}+\dots+\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}y^1+\binom{n}{n}x^{n}y^0=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}x^ky^{n-k}
$$
{% endraw %}

* Corollary 1.1 For each integer {% raw %}$$n\gt0$${% endraw %}.
{% raw %}
$$ 
\binom{n}{0}+\binom{n}{1}+\binom{n}{2}+\dots+\binom{n}{n}=2^n\\
\binom{n}{0}-\binom{n}{1}+\binom{n}{2}-\dots+(-1)^n\binom{n}{n}=0
$$
{% endraw %}

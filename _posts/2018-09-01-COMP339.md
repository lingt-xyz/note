## 1 Fundamental Principles of Counting

### 1.1 The Rules of Sum and Product

* The Rule of Sum: If a first task can be performed in {% raw %}$$m$${% endraw %} ways, while a second task can be performed {% raw %}$$ n$${% endraw %} ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in any on of {% raw %}$$ m + n$${% endraw %} ways.

* The Rule of Product: If a procedure can be broken down into first and second stages, and if there are {% raw %}$$ m$${% endraw %} possible outcomes for the first stage and if, for each of these outcomes, there are {% raw %}$$ n$${% endraw %} possible outcomes for the second stage, then the total procedure can be carried out, in the designated order, in {% raw %}$$ mn$${% endraw %} ways.

### 1.2 Permutations

* Definition 1.1 For an integer {% raw %}$$n\geqslant0$${% endraw %}, {% raw %}$$n factorial$${% endraw %} (denoted {% raw %}$$n!$${% endraw %}) is defined by
    
    {% raw %}
    $$
    n! =
    \begin{cases}
    1,  & \text{if $n=0$} \\
    (n)(n-1)(n-2)\dots(3)(2)(1), & \text{if $n\geqslant1$}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    {% endraw %}

* Definition 1.2 Given a collection of {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} distinct objects, any (linear) arrangement of these objects is called a permutation of the collection. The number of permutations of size {% raw %}$$r$${% endraw %}, where {% raw %}$$0<=r<=n$${% endraw %}, from a collection of {% raw %}$$n$${% endraw %} objects, is 
    {% raw %}
    $$
    P(n,r)={n!\over{n!\over(n-r)!}}
    $$
    {% endraw %}

## Testing
### Who test?
* Outside testers are objective
* Inside testers can be biased, but know their software
* Within a team, worth having developers and colleagues test code

### What is a good test?
* Catches most bugs with least effort
* One from each type of test class
* What might a test class be, given this?
* Testing randomly?
* Testing exhaustively?

### Why types of tests?
* Different types of tests match up with different artifacts
* Different types of tests reveal/confirm different types of issues/features

### What types of tests?
* Unit Testing (P474)
    * Step-by-step with coding
    * In OOD, a unit is usually a class
    *  In functional development, it can be a method/function being tested
    * Makes use of stubs and drivers
    * Should be automated
* Integration Testing
    * Test the quality of the documentation and communication
    * Finding side effects
    * ncremental integration is best
    * Top-down or Bottom-up
        *  Top-down
            * Verifies major control or decision points early
            * Depth-first: tests integration of critical paths of modules
            * Breadth-first: is good as integration is often tight along a horizontal layer
		* Bottom-up
            * Skips the need for stubs
            * builds (or clusters) are groupings of low-level modules that have been integrated
            * drivers test these integrated clusters
            * as you move up, throw out the drivers and replace with next level to be integrated
    * Regression Testing
        * Find a bug, write a test that catches it. 
        * That bug is fixed when regression tests passes
        * That bug should never come back
    * System-level (Validation) Testing
       * Tests user-visible features
       * Tests imitate user interactions with system
    * Acceptance Testing (2.P183)
       * a test of the requirements
       * Leffingwell is focused on Story Acceptance testing, that’s ok
       * Does a user using the system see high level functionality they expect?
       * Does a user using the system see the feature they expect?
       * What about non-functional requirements?
    * Black box Testing
    * White box Testing 
    * Other Types of Tests
       * What types of things from the artifacts aren’t tested by the mentioned tests?

### Testing strategy
* Inception and Elaboration may have more focus on unit test, but still have acceptance tests.
* As you move on, Integration tests and System tests become more relevant
* As soon as you have bugs, regression tests are relevant


## Requirements
### What are requirements?
* "Requirements are capabilities and conditions to which the system–and more broadly, the project–must conform"
* "Inception is Not the Requirements Phase"
* Needs drive features, features drive requirements
* Requirements are best when understood by both developers and customers

### What are stories?
* In Scrum, a Story is a brief statement of intent describing something the system can do for a user
* Stories are negotiable, and should be small enough to make good estimates on
* User Stories are what we are mostly concerned with
* Stories can also include other work items, but those aren’t really related to requirements

### What are features?
* Bridge gap between User needs and Software Solutions (Requirements)
* Most systems described in 25-50 features  Features are Program Backlog items in Scrum
* You can Acceptance Test features

### When we must have requirements?
* Design and development start while only 10-20% of requirements are established
* Requirements, even established ones change
* "on average, 25% of requirements change on software projects"
* Study on waterfall-esque requirements showed 45% were never used, 19 % were rarely used
* Iterative approach: have the requirements you need, when you require them.
